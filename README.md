# E-commerce-data-RFM-analysis

While there is a great deal of data available to modern marketers, it can be challenging to determine which facts are most crucial when it comes to segmenting and rating customers.

* Recency: The time since a consumer last made a purchase
* Frequency: How frequently a customer purchases goods from your store
* Financial value: A customer's total spending with your brand

The RFM model is a technique for segmenting customers that centers on recency, frequency, and monetary value.
Brands may successfully segment their client base and target each group with marketing messages based on their prior behaviors by evaluating their past actions.
